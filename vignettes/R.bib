@article{R-plyr,
abstract = {Many data analysis problems involve the application of a split-apply-combine strategy, where you break up a big problem into manageable pieces, operate on each piece inde- pendently and then put all the pieces back together. This insight gives rise to a new R package that allows you to smoothly apply this strategy, without having to worry about the type of structure in which your data is stored. The paper includes two case studies showing how these insights make it easier to work with batting records for veteran baseball players and a large 3d array of spatio-temporal ozone measurements.},

abstract = {This paper presents the lubridate package for R, which facilitates working with dates and times. Date-times create various technical problems for the data analyst. The paper highlights these problems and offers practical advice on how to solve them using lubridate. The paper also introduces a conceptual framework for arithmetic with date-times in R.},

@article{R-reshape,
abstract = {This paper presents the reshape package for R, which provides a common framework for many types of data reshaping and aggregation. It uses a paradigm of `melting' and `casting', where the data are `melted' into a form which distinguishes measured and identifying variables, and then `cast' into a new shape, whether it be a data frame, list, or high dimensional array. The paper includes an introduction to the conceptual framework, practical advice for melting and casting, and a case study.},
