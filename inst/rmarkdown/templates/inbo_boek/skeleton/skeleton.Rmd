# INBO report with RMarkdown: Bookdown style

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple syntax to format text. Markdown documents^[
Actually, it is an extended version of Markdown that is used already: [Pandoc's Markdown](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown). Pandoc's Markdown extends the application of pure Markdown to many output formats (using the [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/) converter) and it adds many features that are useful in documents, other than webpages.]
can be rendered to different output formats: e.g. PDF, HTML, ePUB, Word, ...
Markdown documents have the *.md extension.

R Markdown adds the possibility of including and executing R code from within the Markdown file. The files use the *.Rmd extension.
More information on R Markdown is available at <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. A tutorial is available at http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html.

When you push the **Knit** button in RStudio, all R code in the document will be executed and its output will be inserted into the document. Then the complete document is rendered using the selected output format.

The output format `pdf_book` renders the document as a PDF with the INBO corporate identity.
Other output formats are provided that will not apply the INBO corporate identity, such as the `html_document2`. They are handy when drafting the report, as they compile quicker than the PDF document.

An MS Word version can be rendered by using the output format `word_document`, but the result is rather poor and needs further tinkering in MS Word, such as applying numbered styles. Also, it does not support cross-referencing, figure numbering, blocks, etc. We therefore don't recommend this output format.

The most important difference between plain RMarkdown and Bookdown is that Bookdown allows to split the book over multiple Rmd files. You can e.g. make a separate Rmd file for each chapter. This makes the Rmd files smaller and easier to maintain.
Bookdown extends on plain RMarkdown, and also provides:

- consistency between different output formats, in numbering and cross-referencing of figures, tables, sections and equations;
- the possibility to insert parts and appendices.
