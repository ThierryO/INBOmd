# INBO report with RMarkdown, bookdown style

## Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple syntax to format text. Markdown documents can be rendered to different output formats: e.g. PDF, HTML, ePUB, Word, ... More information on R Markdown is available at <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. A tutorial is available at http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html

The output style `inbo_rapport_2015` renders the document as a PDF with the INBO corpate identity. An MS-Word version can be rendered by using the output style `word_document`. Note that this will be a simple MS Word document, not rendered into the INBO corpate identity.

When you push the **Knit** button in RStudio, all R code in the document will be executed and it's output will be inserted into the document. Then the complete document is rendered using the selected output style. 

## Bookdown style

The most important difference between plain Rmarkdown and Bookdown is that Bookdown allows to split the book over multiple Rmd files. You can e.g. make a separate Rmd file for each chapter. This makes the Rmd files smaller and easier to maintain. The complete book on Bookdown is available at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown.
