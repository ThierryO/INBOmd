# Applying the INBO corporate identity

The INBO corporate identity is _only_ applied by the output format `pdf_book`, for which the YAML parameter `base_format: INBOmd::inbo_rapport_2015` is specified in this template, unless stated otherwise. Hence, the below YAML parameters should be specified under the output format `pdf_book`, unless stated otherwise.

## Lists of tables and figures

A list of tables and a list of figures will be added automatically. Use `lof: FALSE` in the YAML to suppress the list of figures. Likewise use `lot: FALSE` to suppress the list of tables.

## Floatbarriers

Figures are free to 'float' to a suitable position. This works very well when you have a descent amount of text. If you have a lot of figures with a limited number of text then it is likely that figures float into the next section or subsection. They will never float into the next chapter. If you want to prevent floating into the next section add `floatbarrier: section` to the YAML. Note that this still allows figures to float to the next subsection of the current section. Other options are `floatbarrier: subsection` and `floatbarrier: subsubsection`.

Sometimes you want to prevent floating (and possible switching) of figures or tables _within a specific_ section, subsection or subsubsection. For that purpose you can insert the TeX command `\FloatBarrier` as a separate line, to mark a border across which no floating is allowed. This has been applied in section \@ref(S:tables).

\blandscape

## Page orientation

Page orientation is portrait by default. You can **b**egin landscape-oriented pages at a given position in your document by inserting the command `\blandscape` as a separate line with a blank line before and after. Further in the text, you insert `\elandscape` as a separate line, to mark the position where landscape orientation **e**nds. Again you need to place a blank line before and after.

\elandscape

## Language

The default language is Dutch, in case no `lang` parameter is given in the YAML header. Switching the language affects several things: hyphenation, names of sections, figure, tables, ...

Switch the language by specifying `lang: english` or `lang: french`, etc. in the YAML header.

To change the language of other output formats (where the default is Dutch), you can change the `language` YAML parameters in the `_bookdown.yml` file of your Bookdown project. For English, you can also uncomment or remove these parameters and accept the defaults of the bookdown package.

## Codesize

The relative size of code. Available value from large to small are: normalsize, small, footnotesize, scriptsize and tiny. Normalsize is equivalent to the size of the plain text. Defaults to `codesize: footnotesize`.

```{r results = "asis"}
sizes <- data.frame(
  codesize = c("normalsize", "small", "footnotesize", "scriptsize", "tiny"),
  text = c(78, 86, 95, 107, 143),
  maximum = c(93, 102, 113, 137, 170)
)
kable(
  sizes, 
  booktab = TRUE,
  caption = "Number of characters per line that can be displayed in R code chunks for the different codesizes."
)
```

## Special blocks for PDF and HTML output

The INBO corporate style has some special blocks available. This will work when rendering either to `bookdown::pdf_book` with `base_format: inborapport_2015`, or to HTML-based output formats (like `html_document2` and `gitbook`).
The special blocks can be accomodated in both HTML and PDF at the same time, as below, by combining them in the RMarkdown file.

By making use of the `echo` (TRUE or FALSE) chunk option of the `block2` engine, you can hide blocks that should not be displayed, e.g. dependent on the output format^[The automated way in which it is used below, will only work from within RStudio.].
Note that this is not needed if you only wish to make either PDF or HTML output.

Also, note that unique labels have been inserted in order to cross-reference a block. For example: the [example block](#unique_exampleblock_label).


```{block2, type = "block", echo = (knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to") == "html")}
<A id="unique_block_label"></A>**Title of block**

This is the _content_ of the **HTML block**.

```

```{block2, type = "exampleblock", echo = (knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to") == "html")}
<A id="unique_exampleblock_label"></A>**Title of example block**

This is the _content_ of the **HTML example block**.

```

```{block2, type = "alertblock", echo = (knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to") == "html")}
<A id="unique_alertblock_label"></A>**Title of alert block**

This is the _content_ of the **HTML alert block**.

```




```{block2, type = "block", latex.options = "{\\hypertarget{unique_block_label}{Title of block}}", echo = (knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to") != "html")}

This is the _content_ of the **PDF block**.

```

```{block2, type = "exampleblock", latex.options = "{\\hypertarget{unique_exampleblock_label}{Title of example block}}", echo = (knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to") != "html")}

This is the _content_ of the **PDF example block**.

```

```{block2, type = "alertblock", latex.options = "{\\hypertarget{unique_alertblock_label}{Title of alert block}}", echo = (knitr::opts_knit$get("rmarkdown.pandoc.to") != "html")}

This is the _content_ of the **PDF alert block**.

```
