# Doing more with Markdown and Bookdown {#S:more-stuff}

The below methods are valid for at least the PDF and HTML output formats. Among HTML output formats also belongs the gitbook format (e.g. this book about bookdown is a gitbook: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/).



## Inserting and cross-referencing external figures {#S:external-figures}

_External_ figures can be inserted from within an R code chunk, using the `include_graphics()` function (figure \@ref(fig:externalfig)). The same chunk options apply as in section \@ref(S:figures), including `fig.cap`.

```{r externalfig, fig.cap = "Including an external figure with a caption is easy from an R chunk.", out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
path_to_figure <- system.file("local_tex/tex/latex/inboimage_2015","labo.jpg", package = "INBOmd")
include_graphics(path_to_figure)
```

But external figures can also be inserted and referenced outside R chunks, using pandoc's markdown with a bookdown-styled label: use `![(\#fig:your_unique_figurename)Your caption.](path-to-figure)` to insert a figure with its caption -- see figure \@ref(fig:externalfig2).

![(\#fig:externalfig2)This figure was inserted outside of an R chunk.](`r system.file("local_tex/tex/latex/inboimage_2015","labo.jpg", package = "INBOmd")`){ width=70% }



## Adding tables in Markdown

If you want to write (simple) tables directly as markdown and not from an R code chunk, there are several possible table notations. See http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#tables for more information. In this case, add the caption as a _separate paragraph_ above or below the table, using the following syntax:

    Table: (\#tab:your_unique_tablename)Your table-caption comes here.

An example is provided by table \@ref(tab:damselflies).
