abstract: |
  Please provide an abstract of no more than 250 words in a single paragraph. Abstracts should explain to the general reader the major contributions of the article. References in the abstract must be cited in full within the abstract itself and cited in the text.


significance: |
  Authors must submit a 120-word maximum statement about the significance of their research paper written at a level understandable to an undergraduate educated scientist outside their field of speciality. The primary goal of the Significance Statement is to explain the relevance of the work in broad context to a broad readership. The Significance Statement appears in the paper itself and is required for all research papers.

acknowledgements: |
  Please include your acknowledgments here, set in a single paragraph. Please do not include any acknowledgments in the Supporting Information, or anywhere else in the manuscript.

# Equations

Sample equations. \cite{1}\cite{1,2} \cite{1,2,3}

\begin{align}\label{1.1}
\begin{split}
\frac{\partial u(t,x)}{\partial t} &= Au(t,x) \left(1-\frac{u(t,x)}{K}\right)-B\frac{u(t-\tau,x) w(t,x)}{1+Eu(t-\tau,x)},\\
\frac{\partial w(t,x)}{\partial t} &=\delta \frac{\partial^2w(t,x)}{\partial x^2}-Cw(t,x)+D\frac{u(t-\tau,x)w(t,x)}{1+Eu(t-\tau,x)},
\end{split}
\end{align}

\begin{align}\label{1.2}
\begin{split}
\frac{dU}{dt} &=\alpha U(t)(\gamma -U(t))-\frac{U(t-\tau)W(t)}{1+U(t-\tau)},\\
\frac{dW}{dt} &=-W(t)+\beta\frac{U(t-\tau)W(t)}{1+U(t-\tau)}.
\end{split}
\end{align}

\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{\partial(F_1,F_2)}{\partial(c,\omega)}_{(c_0,\omega_0)} = \left|
\begin{array}{ll}
