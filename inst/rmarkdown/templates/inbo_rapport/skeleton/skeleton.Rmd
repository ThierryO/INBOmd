# INBO report with RMarkdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple syntax to format text. Markdown documents can be rendered to different output formats: e.g. PDF, HTML, ePUB, Word, ... More information on R Markdown is available at <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. A tutorial is available at http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html.

The output format `inbo_rapport_2015` renders the document as a PDF with the INBO corporate identity.
Other output formats are provided that will not apply the INBO corporate identity. The output format `html_document` is handy when drafting the report, as it compiles quicker than the PDF document.

An MS-Word version can be rendered by using the output format `word_document`, but the result is rather poor and needs further tinkering in MS Word, such as applying numbered styles.

## Cross references
\label{S:crossref}

To create a cross reference you need to mark the target with a `\label{your_label}`. Place `\autoref{your_label}` or `\autorefp{yourlabel}` at the position where you need the cross reference. This will insert the correct description and number which will be automatically determined when rendering the pdf, e.g. the `\autoref{}` result: \autoref{S:crossref}; the `\autorefp{}` result:\autorefp{S:crossref}. Note that this will be invisible when rendering to MS Word.

Cross references can be used with headings, figures, tables, ... Place the `\label{your_label}` just after the heading or in the captions. We recommend to add prefixes to the labels:

- `S:` for headings,
- `fig:` for figures,
- `tab:` for tables.

The cross references act as hyperlinks. When you click then you go to the location of the corresponding label. Therefore labels must be unique within the document. You will get an error message when they aren't unique.

# Inserting and executing R code

When you push the **Knit** button in RStudio, all R code in the document will be executed and its output will be inserted into the document. Then the complete document is rendered using the selected output style. You can find an R code chunk below this paragraph. Adding a new code chunk is easy in RStudio by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+I`.

```{r linear_model}
model <- lm(log(pressure) ~ poly(temperature, 2), data = pressure)
summary(model)
```

## Adding figures

Adding R figures is easy\autorefp{fig:RFigure}. The `echo = FALSE` argument was added to the chunk options. This hides the R code that generates the figure. The `fig.cap` argument adds a caption to the figure. The label in the caption has a double `\`. This is required when using `\` in R strings.

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "\\label{fig:RFigure}The caption"}
ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous("Temperature (deg C)") +
  scale_y_log10("Pressure (mm of Hg)") +
  ggtitle("pressure data: Vapor Pressure of Mercury")
```

_External_ figures can be inserted from within an R code chunk, using the `include_graphics()` function (figure \@ref(fig:externalfig)). The same chunk options apply as before, including `fig.cap`.

```{r externalfig, fig.cap = "Including an external figure with a caption is easy.", out.width = "70%", fig.align = "center"}
path_to_figure <- system.file("local_tex/tex/latex/inboimage_2015","labo.jpg", package = "INBOmd")
include_graphics(path_to_figure)
```

## Adding tables

`kable()` is a handy function to display dataframes as a table\autorefp{tab:kabletable}. The table will get a default label which is the prefix `tab:` plus the chunk name. Hence you can display only one table per chunk. Note that we need the argument `results='asis'`.

```{r kabletable, results='asis'}
kable(
  pressure,
  caption = "\\label{tab:kabletable}The caption of a Markdown table"
)
```

# Applying the INBO corporate identity

Note that the INBO corporate identity is _only_ applied by the output format `inbo_rapport_2015`.

## Lists of tables and figures

A list of tables and a list of figures will be added automatically. Use `lof: FALSE` in the YAML to suppress the list of figures. Likewise use `lot: FALSE` to suppress the list of tables.

## Floatbarriers

Figures are free to 'float' to a suitable position. This works very well when you have a descent amount of text. If you have a lot of figures with a limited number of text then it is likely that figures float into the next section or subsection. They will never float into the next chapter. If you want to prevent floating into the next section add `floatbarrier: section` to the YAML. Note that this still allows figures to float to the next subsection of the current section. Other options are `floatbarrier: subsection` and `floatbarrier: subsubsection`.

Sometimes you want to prevent floating (and possible switching) of figures or tables _within a specific_ section, subsection or subsubsection. For that purpose you can insert the TeX command `\FloatBarrier` as a separate line, to mark a border across which no floating is allowed.

## Language

The default language is Dutch, in case no `lang` parameter is given in the YAML header. Switching the language affects several things: hyphenation, names of sections, figure, tables, ...

Switch the language by specifying `lang: english` or `lang: french`, etc. in the YAML header.

## Codesize

The relative size of code. Available value from large to small are: normalsize, small, footnotesize, scriptsize and tiny. Normalsize is equivalent to the size of the plain text. Defaults to `codesize: footnotesize`.

```{r results = "asis"}
sizes <- data.frame(
  codesize = c("normalsize", "small", "footnotesize", "scriptsize", "tiny"),
  text = c(78, 86, 95, 107, 143),
  maximum = c(93, 102, 113, 137, 170)
)
kable(
  sizes, 
  caption = "Number of characters per line that can be displayed in R code chunks for the different codesizes."
)
```
