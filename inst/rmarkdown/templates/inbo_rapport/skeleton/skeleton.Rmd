# INBO report with RMarkdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple syntax to format text. Markdown documents can be rendered to different output formats: e.g. PDF, HTML, ePUB, Word, ... More information on R Markdown is available at <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. A tutorial is available at http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html

The output style `inbo_rapport_2015` renders the document as a PDF with the INBO corpate identity. An MS-Word version can be rendered by using the output style `word_document`. Note that this will be a simple MS Word document, not rendered into the INBO corpate identity.

## Cross references
\label{S:crossref}

To create a cross reference you need to mark the target with a `\label{your_label}`. Place `\autoref{your_label}` or `\autorefp{yourlabel}` at the position where you need the cross reference. This will insert the correct description and number which will be automatically determined when rendering the pdf, e.g. the `\autoref{}` result: \autoref{S:crossref}; the `\autorefp{}` result:\autorefp{S:crossref}. Note that this will be invisible when rendering to MS Word.

Cross references can be used with headings, figures, tables, ... Place the `\label{your_label}` just after the heading or in the captions. We recommend to add prefixes to the labels. `S:` for headings, `fig:` for figures, `tab:` for tables.

The cross references act as hyperlinks. When you click then you go to the local of the corresponding label. Therefore labels must be unique within the document. You will get an error message when they aren't unique.

# R code

When you push the **Knit** button in RStudio, all R code in the document will be executed and it's output will be inserted into the document. Then the complete document is rendered using the selected output style. You can find an R code chunk below this paragraph. Adding a new code chunk is easy in RStudio by pressing `Ctrl + Alt + I`.

```{r linear_model}
model <- lm(log(pressure) ~ poly(temperature, 2), data = pressure)
summary(model)
```

## Adding figures

Adding R figures is easy\autorefp{fig:RFigure}. The `echo = FALSE` argument was added to the chunk options. This hides the R code that generates the figure. The `fig.cap` argument adds a caption to the figure. The label in the caption has a double `\`. This is required when using `\` in R strings.

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "\\label{fig:RFigure}The caption"}
ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", formula = y ~ poly(x, 2)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_x_continuous("Temperature (deg C)") +
  scale_y_log10("Pressure (mm of Hg)") +
  ggtitle("pressure data: Vapor Pressure of Mercury")
```

## Adding tables

`kable()` is a handy function to display dataframes as a table\autorefp{tab:kabletable}. The table will get a default label which is the prefix `tab:` plus the chunk name. Hence you can display only one table per chunk. Note that we need the argument `results='asis'`.

```{r kabletable, results='asis'}
kable(
  pressure,
  caption = "\\label{tab:kabletable}The caption of a Markdown table"
)
```

## Lists of tables and figures

A list of tables and a list of figures will be added automatically. Use `lof: FALSE` is the YAML at the top of the document to suppress the list of figures. Likewise use `lot: FALSE` to suppress the list of tables.

## Floatbarriers

Figures are free to 'float' to a suitable position. This works very well when you have a descent amount of text. If you have a lot of figures with a limited number of text then it is likely that figures float into the next section or subsection. They will never float into the next chapter. If you want to prevent floating into the next section add `floatbarrier: section` to the YAML. Note that this still allows figures to float to the next subsection of the current section. Other options are `floatbarrier: subsection` and `floatbarrier: subsubsection`.

## Language

The default language is Dutch. In that case you don't need to specify the language in the YAML header. Switching the language affects several things: hyphenation, names of sections, figure, tables, ...

## Codesize

The relative size of code. Available value from large to small are: normalsize, small, footnotesize, scriptsize and tiny. Normalsize is equivalent to the size of the plain text. Defaults to `codesize: footnotesize`.

```{r results = "asis"}
sizes <- data.frame(
  codesize = c("normalsize", "small", "footnotesize", "scriptsize", "tiny"),
  text = c(78, 86, 95, 107, 143),
  maximum = c(93, 102, 113, 137, 170)
)
kable(
  sizes, 
  caption = "Number of characters per line that can be displayed in R code chunks for the different codesizes."
)
```
